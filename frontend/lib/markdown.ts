/**
 * Article markdown repair and heading extraction.
 *
 * The generator's output has two consistent artifacts that render badly:
 *
 * 1. **A leading H1.** 175 of 244 bodies open with one, and it is never the
 *    headline the page displays — the display title is the source's headline
 *    ("China's robot-hand unicorn Linkerbot is hunting a $6bn valuation") while
 *    the body writes its own ("Linkerbot: A Pioneer in Dexterous Robotic
 *    Hands"). Rendering both gives the article two competing headlines and two
 *    H1s. The source headline is the more informative of the two and is already
 *    the page's H1, so the body's is dropped.
 *
 * 2. **Setext underlines below ATX headings.** `# Heading` followed by a line
 *    of `=====` is not a setext heading — the ATX line already closed the
 *    block, so the underline renders as a paragraph of equals signs. The `-----`
 *    form is worse: it renders as a horizontal rule, so the corpus is full of
 *    stray dividers directly under headings. 147 of these across 244 documents.
 *
 * An underline directly below *paragraph* text is a real setext heading, and a
 * `---` after a blank line is a real thematic break. Both are kept — but the
 * setext form is rewritten to its ATX equivalent, because the contents list is
 * read off the `#`-prefixed lines and a setext heading would otherwise appear in
 * the body without appearing in the rail.
 *
 * Everything here is markup normalisation. No prose is rewritten.
