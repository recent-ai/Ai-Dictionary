/**
 * Derivations for the archive index.
 *
 * The archive is 244 entries and growing, so the page can't just be the post
 * list rendered end to end — it needs grouping, counts, and a way to narrow.
 * Everything here is computed on the server from the same rows the article
 * pages use; nothing is fetched twice.
 *
 * The entry shape is deliberately lean. Summaries average ~1,130 characters,
 * so shipping all 244 in full would put roughly 275KB of prose into the page
 * for text that is clamped to two lines anyway. They're cut to an excerpt
 * before they ever reach the markup.
