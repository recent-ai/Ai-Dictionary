"""Enrichment — fill the flat `posts` columns the schema exposes but nothing filled.

`difficulty`, `read_time`, and `tags` are real columns on `posts` and the frontend
renders them ("Beginner · 5 min read"), but before this node they were NULL forever.

**Zero extra LLM calls.** The plan originally proposed a fresh structured call here,
but `generate_title_block_node` (inside the summary subgraph) *already* asks the model
for `tags`, `difficulty`, and `estimated_time` — it just drops them into `title_block`
and never maps them onto the columns. So this node harvests what's already generated
and only falls back to an LLM call if that's missing. Given every key in the pipeline
is rate limited, not spending a call is the whole design.

`read_time` is computed **deterministically** from the word count of what we actually
wrote, which is both cheaper and more accurate than asking a model to guess.
