"""Triage gate - the cheap filter that runs before expensive generation.

One structured Groq call per raw item decides whether it is worth writing a post.
Everything downstream is skipped when this says no: filtering costs one call,
while generating a complete post costs several provider calls.

This node is a pure function of its state. An isolated triage failure passes the item
through with `triage["available"] = False` so the run loop can see it; deciding when
repeated failures mean "stop the run" is the loop's job, not this node's, because only
the loop can halt and release the rest of the claimed batch.

You are filtering articles for an AI news platform aimed at beginner developers.
We want concrete, buildable AI developments - NOT generic AI commentary.

Article title: {title}
Article description: {description}

Decide:
1. is_it_relevant: True ONLY if the article is about at least one of:
   - a new or updated AI/ML MODEL (LLM, image/audio/video, embeddings, etc.)
   - a new AI TOOL or DEV TOOL (frameworks, libraries, APIs, SDKs, IDEs, infra)
   - an AI AGENT or agentic system / capability
   - concrete AI RESEARCH with a technical result or method
   - a notable RELEASE / launch / feature in the AI dev ecosystem
   Mark False for everything else, including: generic AI news, business/funding/valuation
   stories, hype or opinion pieces, policy/regulation/ethics debates, "AI will change X"
   think-pieces, and anything with no technical or buildable substance for a developer.
   When in doubt, prefer False.
2. importance: 1 (minor tool/update) to 5 (major model release / breakthrough)
3. reason: one sentence explaining your decision
