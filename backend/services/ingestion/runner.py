"""Tier 1 ingestion runner.

Runs every Tier 1 (trigger) adapter, collects their `RawData` items, and upserts them
into `raw_api_data` with `status='pending'`. Tier 2 (context) sources — Latent Space,
Import AI, etc. — are NOT here; they're wired into the agent's research tools later.

Usage (from the repo root):

    python -m backend.services.ingestion.runner

Run it as a module, not as a file path. The adapter imports below are relative, so
`python backend/services/ingestion/runner.py` puts the script's own directory on
sys.path instead of the repo root and the imports fail.
